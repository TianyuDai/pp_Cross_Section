1. Bias Selection: pT_pow4
2. HardQCD=on SoftQCD=? 
3. inelastic collision: radiation? cross section: multiply with the factor out of generated particles
   elastic: same final state as initial state(p+p->p+p, g+g->g+g), inelastic: different final state(p+p->x, g->gg, g->q+qbar+g), not necessary to be radiation
   radiation: inelastic(g->gg)
4. difference between hard process and soft process
   soft: small deviation
   hard: large deviation(large pT), pQCD region, don't need to be midrapidity(just not accurate in finite rapidity)
5. calculate errorbar
